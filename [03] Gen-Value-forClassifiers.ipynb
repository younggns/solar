We\\'re saving to pay for the new one at the moment.\\n\\nI have one teacher, my English teacher, who constantly makes comments about how banged up looking it is, and gets pretty pissed any time I dare move and it makes noise. She says it\\'s distracting. The comments about the appearance of the chair annoy me a lot because it\\'s hardly going to look brand new after 7 years of constant use.\\n\\nShe made a comment this morning along the lines of \"You know, you should really get a new one, that one looks like it\\'s about to collapse under you\". I got really mad about this and I said, \"You know what, if you think I should get a new chair so bad, you can pay the nearly 4 grand it\\'s gonna cost or you can stop making nasty comments about something that literally doesn\\'t affect you.\" \\n\\nShe didn\\'t really look at me until the end of the class but the boy who sits besides me said it was slightly assholeish as she probably didn\\'t realise how difficult the process was. AITA?',\n",

I have a friend, also [31f], who is not a teacher.\\n\\nShe posted on her Facebook page the following message: “Happy appreciation week to the real teachers out there: parents!  Kids couldn’t do this virtual learning without us!” followed by a lot of hashtags about being mom strong and what not.\\n\\nI didn’t comment on FB because I’m 31 and don’t do FB arguments.  I did, however, bring it up in a conversation we were having over the phone.  We were talking about her child’s virtual schooling (he’s 8) when she said how hard teaching is.  She says this a lot, but I have always blown it off because I never thought she actually believed she was a teacher until this moment.  That’s when I asked her if she really believed that status update she posted, and she said absolutely.  She then said she should be paid for teaching her child and that any teacher virtual should not receive their full salary (before you ask, yes, I am full time in the classroom with average 27 kids each bell).\\n\\nI informed her she was not a teacher.  She was a parent, and she was doing what she should be doing: parenting.  She told me she was because she makes sure her son does his schoolwork.  I told her that’s only a fraction of the job, and I have several other things to do like grading, planning, creating activities, data gathering, assessing, parent contact, meetings, etc.\\n\\nShe told me I was exaggerating and I should thank her for being involved as well as other parents for doing what she does.  That’s when she joked that teachers have an easy job and shouldn’t complain so much.  I told her she was being very dismissive and ignorant.  She told me that since I do not have kids that I don’t get how hard it is for parents to do their own jobs and mine. I just hung up on her and haven’t spoken to her for two days.\\n\\nWas I the asshole here? Our friends are all siding with her but my fiancé is siding with me.',\n",

I retort by saying he drives back home from work when it’s thunderstorming and he’s 20 minutes away from that.

To be fair to him he does have vision problems and has a lot of trouble seeing in the dark even with corrective lenses. Instead he said that he’s calling me a lyft.\n",

      "Lyft arrives in a few minutes and arrives at his house half an hour later on. I’m clearly upset and he asks why and I tell him that he wouldn’t even pick me up and just plays things too safe. He gets upset at me and says he really doesnt want to drive 30 minutes when he cant see and it’s thunderstorming to make it worse. I retort by saying he drives back home from work when it’s thunderstorming and he’s 20 minutes away from that. I don’t remember how the argument devolved after that but we slept in separate beds.\n",

I called to ask him if he was on the way to pick me up but he said no he was at home and he didnt feel safe driving in this weather.

He gets upset at me and says he really doesnt want to drive 30 minutes when he cant see and it’s thunderstorming to make it worse. I retort by saying he drives back home from work when it’s thunderstorming and he’s 20 minutes away from that. I don’t remember how the argument devolved after that but we slept in separate beds.\n",

Then you both could have taken a Lyft or Uber back to his home. He did not show any enthusiasm about seeing you by not showing up at the airport.\n",
